        part1: "I have lived in four countries in the last 10 years, and mobile applications such as Google Maps, Google Translator and CityMapper were helpful in becoming assimilated, especially when I came to the United States. Throughout that time, I was curious about how apps worked, and even before then, about the magic behind computing in general, like when I first saw a computer and wondered how what I was typing was appearing on the screen. I knew that apps were based on a combination of algorithms, data structures, and logic, but I wanted to know more. So when I heard about coding bootcamps, I decided to take a chance and prepared to enroll in one.",
        part2: "In September 2019, I started self-directed online courses with Udemy in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and wrote my very first line of code, which displayed 'Hello, world!'. I was excited and encouraged to learn more.",
        part3: "I entered Fullstack Academy bootcamp six months later. In my first week, I felt completely overwhelmed. It sounded like my instructors were speaking a completely different language, and I worried that my English was insufficient because it is not my first language. Sometimes, I was frustrated to the point of tears. But I was determined not to give up. In April 2020, I was assigned my first solo project to build a single-page application. I was nervous but as my project progressed, my confidence grew. Each challenge made me learn something new about how an object-relational database system works, how React and Redux and other libraries work, and what’s happening with them behind the scenes.",
        part4: "In the bootcamp’s final six weeks, I completed three full-stack projects and learned more about coding with Express, PostgreSQL, React and Redux, and new technologies like React-Native, Expo.io and Chart.js while working in immersive paired and team environments. As a developer, I am excited to bring my experience and knowledge to a work environment where I can learn even more about coding and improve my skills."},
