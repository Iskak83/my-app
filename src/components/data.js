        part1: "My name is Iskak. I'm a Full Stack Engineer with a huge passion to both frontend and backend. I often find myself lost in any part of my projects facing new chalanges, and  getting excited when I solve them. I'm fascinated with libreries like React for the frontend develpment, and Redux for a state managment, or web framework like Express(for Node.js) for a sever side. Now I'm more eager to learn even further like new languagies such as TypeScript, Python, C#, C++, and new frameworks like GraphQL and more.",
        part2: "I was born and raised in Kyrgyzstan. I was always  curious about the magic behind computing in general, like when I first saw a computer in high school and wondered how what I was typing was appearing on the screen. So becuase of that I wanted to go to a computing or tech field after the high school, but lock of resources to get into those fields forced me to pick something else. I admitted to two years General Law course in Kyrgyz Economic University in 2001, and successfully graduated in 2003. After the graduation I realized that law was not the field where I wanted to build my career. I did not give up of finding that right profession. In 2005 I admitted to the General Accounting faculty in Kyrgyz Russian Slavic University, graduated from there in 2011. My life dramaticlly changed 2010th and I had to flee my home country in 2013 to the USA. I have lived in four countries in the last 10 years, and mobile applications such as Google Maps, Google Translator and CityMapper were helpful in becoming assimilated, especially when I came to the United States 7 years ago. I knew that apps were based on a combination of algorithms, data structures, and logic, but I wanted to know more. So when I heard about coding bootcamps, I decided to take a chance and prepared to enroll in one.",
        part3: "In September 2019, I started self-directed online courses with Udemy in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and wrote my very first line of code, which displayed 'Hello, world!'. I was excited and encouraged to learn more. I entered Fullstack Academy bootcamp six months later. In my first week, I felt completely overwhelmed.  But I was determined not to give up. In April 2020, I was assigned my first solo project to build a single-page application. I was nervous but as my project progressed, my confidence grew. Each challenge made me learn something new about how an object-relational database system works, how React and Redux and other libraries work, and what’s happening with them behind the scenes. In the bootcamp’s final six weeks, I completed three full-stack projects and learned more about coding with Express, PostgreSQL, React and Redux, and new technologies like React-Native, Expo.io and Chart.js while working in immersive paired and team environments. As a developer, I am excited to bring my experience and knowledge to a work environment where I can learn even more about coding and improve my skills."
